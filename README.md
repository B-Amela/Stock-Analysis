# Stock-Analysis
The purpose of the project is to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code.

## Overview of Project ##
The purpose of the project is to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code. The code represents stocks, and refactoring it would create a more efficient and faster analysis of the results. The years in question are 2017 and 2018. In the intial run of the code it came back with the below run times. The new code is supposed to result faster then the listed times.

The new results are as follows. The new refactored code has sped up the results for both years.

## Summary ##
### Pros and Cons ###
Refactoring helps make our code cleaner and more organized. A few advantages of a cleaner code include design and software improvement, debugging, and faster programming.
Cons for refactoring code might include the size of code. Refactoring is time consuming, and  it may also land you into a situation where you have no idea where to go further.Sometimes the end solution may not be better than the code that is already present. 

In refactoring this VBA code the biggest benefit that occurred as a result of the refactoring was an decrease in macro run time. The original analysis took approximately 1.5/1.6 seconds to run, whereas our new analysis only took about a fourth of that time (approximately 0.25 seconds) to run.
